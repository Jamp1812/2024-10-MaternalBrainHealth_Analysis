# What contributes to healthy aging of mothers' brains? A comparative analysis of brain age estimation from MRI data and its association with phenotypic characteristics

This project is a survey on the topic of generative AI in student learning. 
It was conducted for a data literacy course at the University of TÃ¼bingen as part of a Cognitive Science Master's degree. 
The project was collaborated on by Jan Goebel and David Mueller. The supervising professor is Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig.

## Abstract

Motherhood represents a chapter in a woman's life that is accompanied by profound biological, psychological and social changes that extend to brain structures and function. Emerging research suggests that these changes may have long-term implications for brain aging. In this study, the relationship between motherhood, stress from repeated pregnancy loss, mindfulness, the ability to regulate emotions and predicted brain age based on MRI scans was investigated. Two data sets were analyzed in this context: MRI data from mothers with unexpected repeated pregnancy loss (RPL) and MRI data from mothers with three-month-old newborns. In addition, psychometric data were included in the analysis in the form of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) and the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS). A fully convolutional neural network was used to predict brain age. The model was able to capture brain age gaps - differences between predicted and chronological aging - as a potential indicator of a person's cognitive and neurological health. The results showed no significant differences in brain age gaps between the RPL and the control group. Likewise, no significant correlations were found between mindfulness (TMS), the ability to regulate emotions (CERQ) or the emotional reactions to one's own newborn and the brain age gaps. These findings suggest that the relationship between motherhood, stress, mindfulness and brain aging may be more subtle or complex than originally thought. Future research with a larger and more diverse sample is needed to better understand the complex mechanisms that drive maternal brain aging.
